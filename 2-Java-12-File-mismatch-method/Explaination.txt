Java 12 introduces an easy way to compare two files using following syntax âˆ’

public static long mismatch(Path path1, Path path2) throws IOException
Where

If there is no mismatch then 1L is returned else position of first mismatch is returned.

Mismatch is accounted in case if file sizes are not matching or byte contents are not matching.
