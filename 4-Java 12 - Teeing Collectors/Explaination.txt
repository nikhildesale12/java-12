Java 12 introduces a new method to Collectors to perform two different operations on collection and then merge the result. 

Folloiwng is the syntax of teeing method âˆ’

Collector<T, ?, R> teeing(
   Collector<? super T, ?, R1> downstream1,
   Collector<? super T, ?, R2> downstream2, 
   BiFunction<? super R1, ? super R2, R> merger
)
Here we are performing different functions on a collection and then merge the result using merger BiFunction.
